# Project 2

## Introduction
This project predicts and compares the possibility of deaths, and critical states of covid-positive patients in Singapore for the upcoming month based on vaccination status using Markov Chain.
The model is used to answer questions such as: 
- In the next month, what is the expected number of deaths and critical state patients among the fully vaccinated?
- In the next month, what is the expected number of deaths and critical state patients among the non-vaccinated?

## Obtaining Data
The dataset has been obtained via the [Ministry of Health website](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/covid-19-case-numbers?resource_id=783f0c4c-caf7-4818-8683-760f3d7f0757). The dataset is called "7-Day moving average of deaths & active cases in ICU, per 100k population, by vax status."

## Method
I construct a full transition matrix associated with the Markov Chain.
